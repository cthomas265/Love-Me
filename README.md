# Love Me

## Description

Through the use of node js and express to create a RESTful API using Handlebars as the template engine and MYSQL and sequelize ORM for the database. We demonstrated the use of routes to get and retrieve data. Also use them to display data on the page.

The site is deployed to heroku on with data and has a polished UI. The site is mobile friendly and uses the bcrypt to encrypt the passwords.
